# Leetcode Problem 1: Two Sum

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.

```

> Approach using JS

```plaintext
Initialization: The function starts by initializing a variable x to 0. This variable is used to iterate through the array nums.

While Loop: The function uses a while loop to iterate through the elements of the array.

Calculate Remaining Value: Inside the loop, it calculates the remaining value (rem) needed to reach the target. This is done by subtracting the current element (nums[x]) from the target.

Check for Pair: It then checks if the remaining value (rem) is present in the array (nums) using the nums.includes(rem) condition. Additionally, it ensures that the remaining value is at a different index than the current element using the condition x !== nums.indexOf(rem).

Return Indices: If a pair of indices is found that satisfies the conditions, the function returns an array containing those two indices.

Iteration: If no pair is found in the current iteration, the loop continues, and x is incremented to move to the next element in the array.

It's worth noting that this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) because, in the worst case, it may need to iterate through the array for each element. If the array is large, this approach may not be efficient. There are more optimized algorithms with a lower time complexity for solving the Two Sum problem, such as using a hash map.

```
### JavaScript Code

```javascript
function twoSum (nums, target) {

    let x = 0;
    
    while (x < nums.length) {
        let rem = target - nums[x];
        if (nums.includes(rem) && x != nums.indexOf(rem)) {
            return [x, nums.indexOf(rem)];
        }
        x++;
    }
}
```

> Approach: Brute Force Approach

- Run two nested loops to check every possible pair of numbers in the given array to see if they add up to the target sum.
- If they add up to the target sum return the indexes.

### C++ Code

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return {i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

### java Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    return new int[] {i, j};
                }
            }
        }
        return new int[] {};
    }
}
```

### Python Code

```Python

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if (i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target):
                    return [i, j]
        return []
        
```

> Optimized Code - TWO PASS HASH TABLE SOLUTION

```plaintext

An optimized approach for the Two Sum problem involves using a hash map to store the elements and their corresponding indices. This allows for a faster lookup of the complement (remaining value needed to reach the target).

```

### JavaScript Code

```javascript

function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const numIndicesMap = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const complement = target - nums[i];

        if (numIndicesMap.has(complement)) {
            return [numIndicesMap.get(complement), i];
        }

        numIndicesMap.set(nums[i], i);
    }

    // No solution found
    return [];
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [2, 7, 11, 15];
const target = 9;
const result = twoSum(nums, target);
console.log(result); // Output: [0, 1]
