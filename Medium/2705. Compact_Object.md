# Leetcode Problem 2705: Compact Object

## Problem Statement

Given an object or array obj, return a compact object. A compact object is the same as the original object, except with keys containing falsy values removed. This operation applies to the object and any nested objects. Arrays are considered objects where the indices are keys. A value is considered falsy when Boolean(value) returns false.

You may assume the obj is the output of JSON.parse. In other words, it is valid JSON.

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: obj = [null, 0, false, 1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: All falsy values have been removed from the array.
Example 2:

Input: obj = {"a": null, "b": [false, 1]}
Output: {"b": [1]}
Explanation: obj["a"] and obj["b"][0] had falsy values and were removed.
Example 3:

Input: obj = [null, 0, 5, [0], [false, 16]]
Output: [5, [], [16]]
Explanation: obj[0], obj[1], obj[3][0], and obj[4][0] were falsy and removed.
 

Constraints:

obj is a valid JSON object
2 <= JSON.stringify(obj).length <= 106
 
```

> Approaches

```plaintext

- Check if obj is null. If so, return null.
- Check if obj is an array.
- If so, we can first use the filter function. In this problem, one should use obj.filter(Boolean). Boolean is a function that returns true if the input value is truthy, and false if falsy. And so, the filter function will iterate through each element of the array and input it into the Boolean function (the filter function calls Boolean(obj[i]) for all valid i), and if the Boolean function returns true, filter will add the element into the return array, otherwise it will leave it out of the return array.

- Next, we should call the map function on the array the filter function returns. The map function replaces each element in the array with the result of inputting the element in a specified function. In this problem, we want to make a recursive call on compactObject for each element, so that we can continue to remove falsy elements in any potential subobjects. So, we write obj.filter(Boolean).map(compactObject); so that the map function will call compactObject(obj[i]) for all i in the array that the filter function returns. To make it clear, one can conceptualize this as: filterArr = obj.filter(Boolean);, return filterArr.map(compactObject);

- Check if obj is not an object. If it isn't return obj.
- If the past three steps have done nothing, that means obj is not null, an array, or not an object. So, it is an object, and we treat it as such.
Create empty variable. Here, it will be called compacted.
- Iterate through each key in obj. For each key, we call compactObject on the key's corresponding value, so we can remove any falsy values in any potential subarrays or subobjects in the value. If the result of this is truthy, we add the key and value to the compacted object. Else, do nothing, we do not want to add the key and falsy value.

- After iterating through all of obj, return compacted.

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

var compactObject = function(obj) {
    // These three if statements deal with when obj is not an iterable object
    // Steps 1-3 as described above
    if (obj === null) return null;
    if (Array.isArray(obj)) return obj.filter(Boolean).map(compactObject);
    if (typeof obj !== "object") return obj;

    // This for loop deals with when obj is an iterable object
    // Steps 4-5 as described above
    const compacted = {};
    for (const key in obj) {
        let value = compactObject(obj[key]);
        if (value) compacted[key] = value;
    }

    return compacted;
};
