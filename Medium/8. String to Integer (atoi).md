# Leetcode Problem 8: String to Integer (atoi)

## Problem Statement

Implement the myAtoi(string s) function, which converts a string to a 32-bit signed integer (similar to C/C++'s atoi function).

The algorithm for myAtoi(string s) is as follows:

- Read in and ignore any leading whitespace.
- Check if the next character (if not already at the end of the string) is '-' or '+'. Read this character in if it is either. This determines if the final result is negative or positive respectively. Assume the result is positive if neither is present.
- Read in next the characters until the next non-digit character or the end of the input is reached. The rest of the string is ignored.
- Convert these digits into an integer (i.e. "123" -> 123, "0032" -> 32). If no digits were read, then the integer is 0. Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).
- If the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. 
- Specifically, integers less than -231 should be clamped to -231, and integers greater than 231 - 1 should be clamped to 231 - 1.
- Return the integer as the final result.
- Note: Only the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.

Do not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: s = "42"
Output: 42
Explanation: The underlined characters are what is read in, the caret is the current reader position.
Step 1: "42" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "42" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "42" ("42" is read in)
           ^
The parsed integer is 42.
Since 42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 42.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   -42"
Output: -42
Explanation:
Step 1: "   -42" (leading whitespace is read and ignored)
            ^
Step 2: "   -42" ('-' is read, so the result should be negative)
             ^
Step 3: "   -42" ("42" is read in)
               ^
The parsed integer is -42.
Since -42 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is -42.
Example 3:

Input: s = "4193 with words"
Output: 4193
Explanation:
Step 1: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is no leading whitespace)
         ^
Step 2: "4193 with words" (no characters read because there is neither a '-' nor '+')
         ^
Step 3: "4193 with words" ("4193" is read in; reading stops because the next character is a non-digit)
             ^
The parsed integer is 4193.
Since 4193 is in the range [-231, 231 - 1], the final result is 4193.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 200
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), digits (0-9), ' ', '+', '-', and '.'.

> Approach for C++

- Initialize variables i (for iterating through the string), sign (to store the sign of the number), and ans (to accumulate the converted integer).
- Skip leading whitespaces by incrementing i until a non-whitespace character is encountered.
- Determine the sign of the number by checking for '-' or '+'. Update the sign variable accordingly.
- Iterate through the remaining characters of the string, converting numeric characters to integers and updating the result (ans).
- Check for overflow conditions during the conversion process. If overflow occurs, return INT_MIN or INT_MAX depending on the sign
Return the final result, considering the sign of the number.

### C++ Code

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string s) 
    {
        int i=0;
        int sign=1;
        long ans=0;
        while(i<s.length() && s[i]==' ')
            i++;
        if(s[i]=='-')
        {
            sign=-1;
            i++;
        }
        else if(s[i]=='+')
            i++;
        while(i<s.length())
        {
            if(s[i]>='0' && s[i]<='9')
            {
                ans=ans*10+(s[i]-'0');
                if(ans>INT_MAX && sign==-1)
                    return INT_MIN;
                else if(ans>INT_MAX && sign==1)
                    return INT_MAX;
                i++;
            }
            else
                return ans*sign;
        }
        return (ans*sign);
    }
};
```

> Approach for Java

- Trim Whitespace: Use the trim() method to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from the string.
Handle Empty String: If the trimmed string is empty, return 0.
- Initialize Variables: Declare variables to store the result (ans) and the current index (i). 
- Additionally, determine if the number is negative (neg) or positive (pos).
- Check for Signs: If a sign is present at the beginning of the string, move to the next character.
Process Digits: Iterate through the string, converting characters to digits. Update the result (ans) by multiplying it by 10 and adding the current digit.
- Check for Overflow: Ensure that the result doesn't exceed the limits of Integer.MAX_VALUE. If overflow is detected, return the appropriate extreme value (either Integer.MIN_VALUE or Integer.MAX_VALUE).
- Adjust for Sign: If the number was negative, multiply the result by -1.
- Return the Final Result: Return the computed integer as the final result.


### Java Code

```java

class Solution {
    public int myAtoi(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int ans = 0, i = 0;
        boolean neg = s.charAt(0) == '-';
        boolean pos = s.charAt(0) == '+';

        if (neg || pos) {
            i++;
        }

        while (i < s.length() && Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))) {
            int digit = s.charAt(i) - '0';

            if (ans > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || (ans == Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 && digit > Integer.MAX_VALUE % 10)) {
                return neg ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            }

            ans = ans * 10 + digit;
            i++;
        }

        return neg ? -ans : ans;
    }
}
