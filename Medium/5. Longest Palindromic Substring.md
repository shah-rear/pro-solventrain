# Leetcode Problem 5: Longest Palindromic Substring

## Problem Statement
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consist of only digits and English letters.
 
```

### C++ Code

```C++

class Solution {
private: 
    bool check(string &s, int i, int j){
        while(i<j){
            if(s[i] != s[j]){
                return false;
            }
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }            
public:
    string longestPalindrome(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        int starting_index = 0;
        int max_len = 0;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=i; j<n; j++){
                if(check(s, i, j)){
                    if(j-i+1 > max_len){
                        max_len = j-i+1;
                        starting_index = i;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return s.substr(starting_index, max_len);
    }
}; 

```

> Approach Explanation

Let's walk through Example 1 ("babad") and see how the code processes it:

Input: s = `"babad"`

#### Initialization:

- n (length of the string) is initially set to 5 (the length of "babad").
- starting_index and max_len are initialized to 0.
Outer Loop (i-loop):

The outer loop `(for(int i=0; i<n; i++))` iterates over each character of the string.

#### - Iteration 1 (i=0):

- Inner Loop `(for(int j=i; j<n; j++))` starts with `j=0` and goes up to `j=4`.

- Substring "b" `(j=0)`:

 - check("babad", 0, 0) returns true (a single character is always a palindrome).
 - Length of the current palindrome substring is 1.
 - Since 1 > max_len (initially 0), update max_len to 1 and starting_index to 0.
-Substring "ba" (j=1):

 - check("babad", 0, 1) returns false (not a palindrome).
- Substring "bab" (j=2):

 - check("babad", 0, 2) returns true.
- Length of the current palindrome substring is 3.
Since 3 > max_len (1), update max_len to 3 and starting_index to 0.
... and so on.

#### - Iteration 2 (i=1):

The process repeats, checking all substrings starting from index 1.
... and so on.

#### Result:

After completing all iterations of the outer and inner loops, the function returns s.substr(starting_index, max_len), which is s.substr(0, 3), giving the substring "bab".

The function could also find "aba" as another valid palindrome substring, but it returns the first one it encounters.

#### Final Output: "bab"

The `check` function takes a string s and two indices i and j, representing the substring from index i to j (inclusive). It uses a two-pointer approach where i starts from the beginning of the substring, and j starts from the end. It compares characters at these indices and moves towards the center of the substring.

Let's apply the function to the examples:

Substring "bab" `(i=0, j=2)`:

- Iteration 1: s[0] (b) is compared with s[2] (b), and they match.
- Iteration 2: s[1] (a) is compared with s[1] (a), and they match.
The loop exits, and the function returns true. The substring "bab" is a palindrome.

Substring "baba" `(i=0, j=3)`:

- Iteration 1: s[0] (b) is compared with s[3] (a), and they don't match.
- The function immediately returns false because there is a mismatch at the first iteration.

In summary, the check function returns true for "bab" because, during the two-pointer traversal, all corresponding characters match. However, for "baba," there is a mismatch, so the function returns false.
