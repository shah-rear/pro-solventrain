# Leetcode Problem 2620. Counter

## Problem Statement

Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, ["call","call","call"]
Output: [10,11,12]
 
Explanation: 
counter() = 10 // The first time counter() is called, it returns n.
counter() = 11 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.
counter() = 12 // Returns 1 more than the previous time.

Example 2:

Input: n = -2, ["call","call","call","call","call"]

Output: [-2,-1,0,1,2]
Explanation: counter() initially returns -2. Then increases after each sebsequent call.
 
Constraints:

-1000 <= n <= 1000
0 <= calls.length <= 1000
calls[i] === "call"
 
```

> Approaches

```plaintext

One way to implement this function is to use a closure - we define an outer function that takes the initial count as a parameter, and returns an inner function that increments and returns the count on each call. The inner function has access to the count variable of the outer function, and since the outer function has already returned, the inner function's closure retains a reference to the count variable. This allows the inner function to maintain the state of the count between calls.

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

function createCounter(start) {
  let count = start;
  return function() {
    return count++;
  }
}

```
### Java Code

```java

public class CounterCreator {
    private int count;

    public CounterCreator(int start) {
        this.count = start;
    }

    public int getNext() {
        return count++;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CounterCreator counterCreator = new CounterCreator(10);
        System.out.println(counterCreator.getNext());  // Output: 10
        System.out.println(counterCreator.getNext());  // Output: 11
    }
}


```
### Python Code

```python

class CounterCreator:
    def __init__(self, start):
        self.count = start

    def get_next(self):
        result = self.count
        self.count += 1
        return result

# Example usage:
counter_creator = CounterCreator(10)
print(counter_creator.get_next())  # Output: 10
print(counter_creator.get_next())  # Output: 11


```
