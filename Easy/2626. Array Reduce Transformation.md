# Leetcode Problem 2626: Array Reduce Transformation

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, a reducer function fn, and an initial value init, return the final result obtained by executing the fn function on each element of the array, sequentially, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element.

This result is achieved through the following operations: val = fn(init, nums[0]), val = fn(val, nums[1]), val = fn(val, nums[2]), ... until every element in the array has been processed. The ultimate value of val is then returned.

If the length of the array is 0, the function should return init.

Please solve it without using the built-in Array.reduce method.
 
### Expected Behaviours 
 
```plaintext
 
Example 1:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr; }
init = 0

Output: 10

Explanation:

initially, the value is init=0.
(0) + nums[0] = 1
(1) + nums[1] = 3
(3) + nums[2] = 6
(6) + nums[3] = 10

The final answer is 10.

Example 2:

Input: 
nums = [1,2,3,4]
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return accum + curr * curr; }
init = 100

Output: 130
Explanation:
initially, the value is init=100.
(100) + nums[0] * nums[0] = 101
(101) + nums[1] * nums[1] = 105
(105) + nums[2] * nums[2] = 114
(114) + nums[3] * nums[3] = 130

The final answer is 130.

Example 3:

Input: 
nums = []
fn = function sum(accum, curr) { return 0; }
init = 25
Output: 25

Explanation: For empty arrays, the answer is always init.

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
0 <= init <= 1000

> Approaches

```plaintext

Using a loop and an accumulator variable:

This approach involves initializing an accumulator variable to the initial value, and then looping through each element in the array, applying the reducer function to the current accumulator value and the current element, and updating the accumulator with the result.
The final value of the accumulator is returned as the output.

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
  let acc = init;
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    acc = fn(acc, nums[i]);
  }
  return acc;
};

```
```plaintext

Using Array.forEach():

This approach uses the Array.forEach() method to loop through each element in the array and apply the reducer function to the current accumulator value and the current element.
The final value of the accumulator is returned as the output.
Javascript Solution:

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
  let acc = init;
  nums.forEach((element) => {
    acc = fn(acc, element);
  });
  return acc;
};
```
```plaintext

Using recursion:
This approach recursively applies the reducer function to the current element and the result of applying the reducer function to the remaining elements in the array.
The initial value is used as the accumulator value for the first call to the recursive function.

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
  let acc = init;
  nums.forEach((element) => {
    acc = fn(acc, element);
  });
  return acc;
};

```
```plaintext

Using Array.reduce:
This approach uses the built-in Array.reduce() method to process each element of the array and update the accumulator variable.

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

var reduce = function(nums, fn, init) {
  return nums.reduce((acc, element) => fn(acc, element), init);
};

```
