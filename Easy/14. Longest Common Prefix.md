# Leetcode Problem 14: Longest Common Prefix

## Problem Statement

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.


### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

Constraints:

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

 
```

> Approaches

- If the input array strs is empty, return an empty string because there is no common prefix.

- Initialize a variable prefix with an initial value equal to the first string in the array strs[0].

- Iterate through the rest of the strings in the array strs starting from the second string (index 1).

- For each string in the array, compare its characters with the characters of the prefix string.

- While comparing, if we find a mismatch between the characters or if the prefix becomes empty, return the current value of prefix as the longest common prefix.

- After iterating through all strings, return the final value of prefix as the longest common prefix.

### C++ Code

```C++

class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        if (strs.empty()) return "";
        string prefix = strs[0];
        for (string s : strs)
            while (s.find(prefix) != 0)
                prefix = prefix.substr(0, prefix.length() - 1);
        return prefix;
    }
};

```
### Java Code

```java

public class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) return "";
        String prefix = strs[0];
        for (String s : strs)
            while (s.indexOf(prefix) != 0)
                prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length() - 1);
        return prefix;
    }
}


```
### Python Code

```python

class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs):
        if not strs:
            return ""
        prefix = strs[0]
        for string in strs[1:]:
            while string.find(prefix) != 0:
                prefix = prefix[:-1]
                if not prefix:
                    return ""
        return prefix

```


Here's a breakdown of the code with explanations:

1. Handling Empty Input:

```C++
if (strs.empty()) return "";
```

Checks if the input array strs is empty. If it is, there can't be any common prefix, so it returns an empty string "".

2. Initializing Prefix:

```C++
string prefix = strs[0];
```
Starts with the first string in the array as the initial prefix. This assumes that at least one string exists in the array (as checked in the previous step).

3. Iterating and Refining Prefix:

```C++
for (string s : strs) {
    while (s.find(prefix) != 0) {
        prefix = prefix.substr(0, prefix.length() - 1);
    }
}
```
Iterates through each string s in the array strs:
Uses s.find(prefix) != 0 to check if prefix is indeed a prefix of the current string s:

If not found at the beginning (index 0), it shortens the prefix by one character from the end using prefix.substr(0, prefix.length() - 1).
This process continues until prefix becomes a prefix of s or becomes empty.

4. Returning the Final Prefix:

```C++
return prefix;
```

After iterating through all strings, the remaining prefix represents the longest common prefix among all the strings in the array. It's returned as the result.
Key Points:

- The code iteratively refines the prefix based on each string's characters.
- It stops when a mismatch is found or the prefix becomes empty.
- It efficiently finds the longest common prefix without unnecessary string comparisons.

Example:

For strs = ["flower", "flow", "flight"]:

- Initial prefix = "flower".
- Iteration 1: prefix remains "flower" (already a prefix of "flower").
- Iteration 2: prefix becomes "flow" (shortened to match "flow").
- Iteration 3: prefix remains "fl" (shortened to match "flight").
- Final prefix is "fl", which is the longest common prefix.
