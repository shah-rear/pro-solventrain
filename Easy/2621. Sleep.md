# Leetcode Problem 2621. Sleep

## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer millis, write an asynchronous function that sleeps for millis milliseconds. It can resolve any value.
 
### Expected Behaviours 
 
```plaintext
 
Example 1:

Input: millis = 100
Output: 100
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 100ms.
let t = Date.now();
sleep(100).then(() => {
  console.log(Date.now() - t); // 100
});
 
Example 2: 
 
Input: millis = 200
Output: 200
Explanation: It should return a promise that resolves after 200ms.
 
Constraints:
 
1 <= millis <= 1000
 
```
 
> Approaches

```plaintext

- The sleep function takes a positive integer millis as input.
- It then creates a Promise that resolves after millis milliseconds using the setTimeout function.
- The Promise is then awaited using the await keyword, which allows the function to pause execution until the Promise is resolved.
- If you are not familar with 'await' then you may use 'return' instead like this:
return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, millis));

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

async function sleep(millis) {
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, millis));
}

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

async function sleep(millis) {
    
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(()=> {
            resolve(millis);
        }, millis);
    });
}

```
### Javascript Code

```javascript

async function sleep(millis) {
    let t = Date.now();
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, millis));
    console.log(Date.now() - t);
}

```
