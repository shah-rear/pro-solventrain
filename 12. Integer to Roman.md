# Leetcode Problem 12: Integer to Roman

## Problem Statement

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

### Expected Behaviours

```plaintext

Example 1:

Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
Example 2:

Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
Example 3:

Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

Constraints:

1 <= num <= 3999
 
```

> Approach with C++

- The code uses a loop to append "M" to the string s while n is greater than or equal to 1000. It then subtracts 1000 from n.
- It checks for special cases where n is equal to or greater than 900, 500, 400, 90, 50, 40, 9, 5, and 4, and appends the corresponding Roman numeral symbols to the string s. It then subtracts the corresponding values from n.
- The code uses another set of loops to append "C", "X", and "I" to the string s while n is greater than or equal to 100, 10, and 1, respectively.
Finally, the function returns the constructed string s.

### C++ Code

```C++

class Solution {
public:
        string intToRoman(int n) {
string s="";
       while(n>=1000){
          s=s+'M';
          n=n-1000;
       }
       if(n>=900){
          s=s+"CM";
          n=n-900;
       }
       if(n>=500){
          s=s+'D';
          n=n-500;
       }
       if(n>=400){
          s=s+"CD";
          n=n-400;
       }
       while(n>=100){
          s=s+'C';
          n=n-100;
       }
       if(n>=90){
          s=s+"XC";
          n=n-90;
       }
       if(n>=50){
          s=s+'L';
          n=n-50;
       }
       if(n>=40){
          s=s+"XL";
          n=n-40;
       }
      while(n>=10){
          s=s+'X';
          n=n-10;
       }
       if(n>=9){
          s=s+"IX";
          n=n-9;
       }
       if(n>=5){
          s=s+'V';
          n=n-5;
       }
       if(n>=4){
          s=s+"IV";
          n=n-4;
       }
       while(n--){
          s=s+"I";
       }
    return s;
}
};

```
> Approach with Java

- Initialize: Create a StringBuilder sb to store the constructed Roman numeral.
Define Symbol Arrays:
- Create arrays for thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones, containing their respective Roman symbols.
These arrays cover values from 0 to 9 for each digit place.
- Iterate through Digit Places:
 - Extract the digit for each place value (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) using division and modulo operations.
 - Append the corresponding Roman symbol(s) from the respective array to sb.
 - Return the Roman Numeral: Return the constructed Roman numeral string from sb.

### Java Code

```java

class Solution {
    public String intToRoman(int num) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("");
        // Define the symbols and values for each digit place
        String[] thousands = {"", "M", "MM", "MMM"};
        String[] hundreds = {"", "C", "CC", "CCC", "CD", "D", "DC", "DCC", "DCCC", "CM"};
        String[] tens = {"", "X", "XX", "XXX", "XL", "L", "LX", "LXX", "LXXX", "XC"};
        String[] ones = {"", "I", "II", "III", "IV", "V", "VI", "VII", "VIII", "IX"};
        // Append the symbols for each digit place from left to right
        sb.append(thousands[num / 1000]);
        sb.append(hundreds[(num % 1000) / 100]);
        sb.append(tens[(num % 100) / 10]);
        sb.append(ones[num % 10]);
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
